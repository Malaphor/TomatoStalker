Stalk your tomatoes

## Overview

This project uses a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller to keep tabs on soil moisture, temperature and humidity and display that data in a simlle web interface. The MCU I chose is a [Particle Photon](https://docs.particle.io/photon/) with 5 soil moisture sensors, a temperature and humidity sensor, a small battery pack and a small solar panel for charging.

## Code

There are 2 main software parts to this project, code that runs on the Photon and code that runs on the server. The code
